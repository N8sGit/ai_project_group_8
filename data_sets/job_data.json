You will be joining a strong team with domain experts ready to teach you anything you don’t already know. An exact match on skills is less critical than strong design instincts, high quality coding discipline and enthusiasm for taking on an ambitious project that will reshape the way people interact with enterprise software.

With experienced leaders in the field and collaborative partnerships with some of the world’s largest automakers, we’re building self-driving technology that is engineered to scale globally and transform mobility for millions.\n\nTalented individuals join our team because they share our purpose to make it safe, easy, and enjoyable for everyone to get around cities. We aspire to impact key industries that move people and goods, from ride hailing to deliveries.\n\nMeet The Team\n\nMachine learning, more specifically deep learning algorithms (detection, segmentation, and fusion tasks) are one of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles and a key part of our autonomy stack. Self-driving cars need to perceive objects and actors around the vehicle to make the correct decisions. The implementation must meet rigorous real time constraints and reliably report detections in 2D or 3D spaces. Ultimately, we must not only solve the algorithm challenges but produce safety-quality high performance software. So this position is as much a software challenge as it is a core algorithm challenge.\n\nWe are seeking hands on candidates who have a mix of computer vision, machine learning expertise, embedded and real time constraints and low level accelerators (FPGA, GPUs). We are looking for practitioners who will be deep in code, and are technically strong in software and (ideally) strong in applied machine learning algorithms. Candidates need not have worked on self-driving, or robotics applications. Candidates with extremely strong skills in some areas but weaker in others will be considered with a bias towards strong software engineering skills.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\nCore models used for scene understanding that are front and center in the perception pipelineResearch projects improving not only our current image space but also radar, LiDar space detection algorithms and best methods to fuse together to improve performanceTurning algorithm exploration that performs best on rigorous and pragmatic A vs B experiments evaluated extensively on data into models/software running on the vehicleWorking with data collection to select and label relevant data to improve our supervised trainingWorking with label tooling team to adjust labeling policies, and approaches to obtain the best label set needed\nWhat We're Looking For\nDegree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related fieldStrong software engineering skills are required but we are language agnosticA willingness to gain stronger software engineering knowledge and deep expertise in C++ and/or python is requiredStrong theoretical and applied knowledge of relevant subsets of detection algorithmsStrong desire for candidates with hands on experience that have deployed real products or platforms into the real world and intimately understand the challenges of working with complex systemsExperienced software engineer or research with a track record of real world applications incorporating machine learning and computer visionPythonC++Realtime applicationsExperience with real world applications of machine learning and computer visionClassification, scene understanding, object detection classes of algorithmsFamiliarity with Mxnet, caffe, tensorflow or other similar deep net or machine learning packagesGPU expertise\nWhat We Offer You\nHigh-quality individual and family medical, dental, and vision insuranceCompetitive compensation packagesEmployer-matched 401(k) retirement plan with immediate vestingEmployer-paid group term life insurance and the option to elect voluntary life insurance Paid parental leaveAdoption & Surrogacy Assistance ProgramPaid medical leave30 day paid sabbatical upon 5 years of employmentUnlimited vacationComplimentary daily lunches, beverages, and snacksPre-tax commuter benefitsMonthly wellness stipend Professional development reimbursementEmployee assistance programDiscounted programs that include legal services, identity theft protection, pet insurance, and moreCompany and team bonding outlets: employee resource groups, quarterly team activity stipend, and wellness initiatives\nOur Background\n\nArgo AI was founded in late 2016 by industry experts with extensive experience building robotic systems for commercial applications. Our once-small team has since grown into an over 1,000-person strong company with strategic partnerships with two of the world’s leading automakers: Ford and Volkswagen. Our self-driving system is the first with commercial deployment plans for Europe and the U.S., and thanks to an ability to tap into both automakers’ global reach, our technology platform has the largest geographic deployment potential of any self-driving technology to date.\n\nAt Argo AI, we believe that embracing differences delivers superior results. We are an equal opportunity employer that is committed to an inclusive environment for all employees.","seniority":"Mid-Senior level","employment_type":"Full-time","location":"Pittsburgh,

Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're \"old\" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box! But \"Digital Transformation\" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.)
