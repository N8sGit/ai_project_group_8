## Abstract

### Project Details

* The objective of our EDA was to address concerns about the oversatuaration of applicants for Machine Learning jobs given the increased popularity in Artificial Intelligence by learning more about the job market trends for machine leaning positions. Initially, our parameter for exploring ML jobs was broad and included how trends for this position have impacted many different job sectors, resulting in the following key questions:
    *   Which job sector has ML roles impacted the most?
    *   Geographically, where are most ML jobs located?
    *   Are most ML job postings for remote, on-site, a hybrid  working model?
    *   How much experience is required for ML roles?
    *   What job skills are required for ML jobs?
    *   How much ML job growth will there be in the next 5 years?
    *   What are professional development trends regarding ML roles.

### Thesis

Thesis/Hypothesis: There are entry level machine learning jobs available, offering an on-site/remote hybrid work model, especially for applicants who live in tech hub States and are proficient in python, sql, and tableau. The number of these jobs will continue to increase given the popularity of AI.

## Data

### Datasets

We reviewed datasets that provided the most opportunity for a thorough of our key questions:
* Combined data from US Census API: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance.html
* 2022 5-year estimate data from US Census API: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance.html

### Data Phases
* Data Fetching: Google searchers, Kaggle, LinkedIn, Census API search
* Software Version Control: Repository created on GitHub, GitHub Projects used to create and track tasks based on key questions, Git branch used to upload files to from local computer to remote repository, utilized "compare & pull requests" to compare branch changes before merging into the main branch.
* Data Exploration: Imported CSV files, created dataframes, utlized pandas and python functions to search and select data related to machine learning jobs, identifying job sectors, experience levels, skills, and employment trends for further aggregation and analysis.
* Data Preparation & Cleanup: Utilized dictionarys, list, loops, column slicing, string manipulation, to ensure high quality and structured data is visualized and fed into the machine to identify patterns, correlation, and predictive analysis. 

## Methods 

* Outline the data exploration, cleanup, transformation, analysis, training, testing, and results for the following questions centered around the following:
    * Job Sector
    * Locations/Geography
    * Job Levels/Education
        * Census Data for Technology Careers
        * Education Levels
        * Employment vs Unemployment
        * Prophet Time Series Predictive Model      
    * Job Skills
        * Why the following skills associated with AI/ML so low on the skill count: pytorch, TensorFlow
        * Full stack AI approach includes: javascript, typescript, react.
        * Javascript vs Python

## Results

### Findings

* Conclusions we were able to deduce.

* Visualizations: <img src='' title='AI Skills' alt='A display of 6-8 AI related visualizations.'/>

### Lingering Questions
 * To explore later: AI in manufacturing jobs, more job level granularity.
